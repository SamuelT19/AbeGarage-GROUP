        <p className='purpose'>Oxygen sensor replacement involves removing and installing a new sensor that measures the oxygen levels in a vehicle's exhaust gases. This sensor helps the engine control unit (ECU) adjust the air-fuel mixture for optimal combustion. Replacing a faulty oxygen sensor can improve fuel efficiency, reduce emissions, and prevent engine performance issues. Typically, oxygen sensors need replacement every 60,000 to 90,000 miles or when symptoms like poor fuel economy and rough idling occur.</p>
