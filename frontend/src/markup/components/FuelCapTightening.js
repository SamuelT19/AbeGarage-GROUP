          <p className='purpose'>Fuel cap tightening involves ensuring that the gas cap is securely fastened after refueling. A properly tightened fuel cap prevents fuel vapors from escaping, which helps maintain fuel system pressure, improves fuel efficiency, and reduces emissions. Additionally, it prevents the "Check Engine" light from triggering due to a loose or missing cap. Regularly checking and tightening the fuel cap is a simple yet important step in vehicle maintenance.</p>
