        <p className='purpose'>Spark plug replacement is a key maintenance task for ensuring your vehicle's engine runs smoothly. Spark plugs ignite the air-fuel mixture in the engine cylinders, essential for starting and powering the engine. Over time, spark plugs can wear out or become fouled, leading to poor engine performance, reduced fuel efficiency, and difficulty starting the vehicle. Replacing spark plugs at regular intervals, as recommended by the manufacturer (typically every 30,000 to 100,000 miles), helps maintain optimal engine performance and prevent potential engine damage.</p>
