        <p className='purpose'>The ignition system is responsible for generating the spark that ignites the air-fuel mixture in a vehicle's engine cylinders, enabling combustion. Key components include the spark plugs, ignition coil, distributor, and ignition switch. A well-functioning ignition system ensures efficient engine starting, smooth performance, and optimal fuel efficiency. Regular maintenance and timely replacement of worn components are essential to prevent misfires, hard starts, and engine performance issues.</p>
